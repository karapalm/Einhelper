Quick AHK script that uses an OCR library to scan for text in a specific part of the screen. 
X,Y on line 17 of EinHelper.ahk is the starting position and then the width and height are defined there as well. 
Box is formed on the screen for the detected text and a sound is played. Scanning begins when grave/back quote is held and stops when released.

Using image recognition now instead of OCR since 3.27 or 3.26 added the Einhar icon.
